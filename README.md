# Hitchhiking Map

Find the best hitchhiking spots around you!

Hitchhiking Maps gathers all the hitchhiking spots from the Hitchwiki Maps website and presents them on a map. The main functionalities are:
- Move around in the map to see hitchhiking spots anywhere in the world.
- Know the rating of each spot (0-5 stars).
- See detailed info about each spot (how to get there, average waiting time, user comments etc).
- Take a snapshot of the map for offline use.
- Bookmark a spot for offline use.

This is the first version of the app, new features such as adding/editing spots, downloading an offline map, or accessing Hitchwiki offline are coming out very soon.

Happy hitchhiking everybody!
